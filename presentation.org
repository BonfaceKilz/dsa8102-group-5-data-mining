#+TITLE: Profanity and Political check in Twitter for website feeds (Group 5)
#+AUTHOR: Rose Kwamboka, Dasiy Mboya, Juma Matundura, Jeremy Gachanja, Antoinette Mutugi, Bonface M. K.

* Introduction

- Social Media is distracting.

- Use cases where social media is useful:
  - Dashboard of major conferences/ workshops (FOSDEM)
  - Hackathons
  - As part of a website

- Is there a way to filter content to remove non-relevant
  content(politics/ profane sentiments)?

Example Politic content:
- Trump won/ lost the elections

Not relevant for a feed that's supposed to show Scientific data!

(Ambitious) AIM: Present a WIP demo of the idea!

* How does this project work?

- Pipelines: Cleaning the data(pre-processing), storage, later
  retrieval

 - 2 Parts:
   Data retrieval-- A daemon!
   Data Viewing-- A feed!

** Scraping

- Scraping happens every 10 seconds.

- We use [[https://github.com/twintproject/twint][Python-twint]]

- No API required. Max of about ~ 10K- 18k tweets mine-able!

- Open-source

** Pre-processing and filtering

- Remove stop-words
- Lemmatize-- Reduce words to core meaning .e.g. Thieves -> Thief
  (important for following step)
- Check for profanity and political sentiments. We use [[https://github.com/snguyenthanh/better_profanity][better_profanity]]

** Storage

- Store data to REDIS using a daemon.

  Why Redis?

- Features for expiring data
- Light weight and open-source
- Easy to set-up
- Reduced code boiler-plate

** Display

- Data is displayed in a browser(demo)
- Same data could be displayed as part of another feed!

* Drawbacks

- Some words are anonymous like "resignation". False hits.
- How to rank tweets wrt popularity, say retweets and likes; and
  relevance
- Different formats of content from different spaces(like commits on
  public repos)!


* Code

See this [[https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/dsa8102-group-5-data-mining][link]]

* Future Work

- Use a robust text-classifying model for ranking(see BioSentVec(26
  GB!))

- Find a way to score tweets so that the most relevant data is
  displayed. Atm, only filtered out tweets are displayed. The list can
  get long!

- Fetch data from other social media platforms: Slack, IRC, Matrix,
  Fedi-verse, etc etc

- Aggregate data from code repositories
